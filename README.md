grange
======

A golang port of librange.

Incomplete and not ready to be used for anything.

Goals
-----

* Easily run cross-platform.
* Good error messages for query language.
* Fast. (Looking at you, `clusters`.)

Development
-----------

This is library, so does not export a main function. Run it via tests.

    go test

Notes
-----

* Parser and lexer are still in flux, I'm just toying with ideas.
